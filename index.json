Para tratar de entender mejor cuál es el papel de la microbiota en estas enfermedades, en la última década, numerosos estudios han combinado estudios de la composición de la microbiota con estudios en los que se evalúan directamente las funciones de la misma, usando herramientas como la metatranscriptómica.","tags":["Metatranscriptomics","Human microbiome"],"title":"Estudiando las funciones de la microbiota intestinal: presente y futuro de la metatranscriptómica","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our group leader, Verónica Lloréns-Rico, gave an invited talk at the FISABIO Institute in Valencia.\nShe presented the different projects being currently performed in the Systems Biology of Host-Microbiome Interactions lab at the CIPF.

Here we study the fecal microbiota of 589 patients at different colorectal cancer (CRC) stages and compare observations with up to 15 published studies (4,439 patients and controls total). Using quantitative microbiome profiling based on 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing, combined with rigorous confounder control, we identified transit time, fecal calprotectin (intestinal inflammation) and body mass index as primary microbial covariates, superseding variance explained by CRC diagnostic groups. Well-established microbiome CRC targets, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, did not significantly associate with CRC diagnostic groups (healthy, adenoma and carcinoma) when controlling for these covariates. In contrast, the associations of Anaerococcus vaginalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Prevotella intermedia remained robust, highlighting their future target potential. Finally, control individuals (age 22–80 years, mean 57.7 years, standard deviation 11.3) meeting criteria for colonoscopy (for example, through a positive fecal immunochemical test) but without colonic lesions are enriched for the dysbiotic Bacteroides2 enterotype, emphasizing uncertainties in defining healthy controls in cancer microbiome research. Together, these results indicate the importance of quantitative microbiome profiling and covariate control for biomarker identification in CRC microbiome studies.","tags":["Fusobacterium nucleatum","Human microbiome"],"title":"Microbiome confounders and quantitative profiling challenge predicted microbial targets in colorectal cancer development","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Ana Rosa!\nAna Rosa Márquez obtained one of the best oral presentation awards at the VIII Trobada d’Investigadors en Càncer Ciutat d’Alcoi, where she presented her preliminary results on the REGUBIOME project.

Early evidence suggests that the respiratory microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 respiratory microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n = 58) and lower (n = 35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We find that time in the intensive care unit and type of oxygen support, as well as associated treatments such as antibiotic usage, explain the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, while SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a reduced impact. Specifically, mechanical ventilation is linked to altered community structure and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomics of the lower respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients identifies specific oral bacteria in physical association with proinflammatory immune cells, which show higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.","tags":["COVID-19","Single-cell RNA-seq","Human microbiome"],"title":"Clinical practices underlie COVID-19 patient respiratory microbiome composition and its interactions with the host","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Verónica Lloréns-Rico","Sara Vieira-Silva","Pedro J.

Generating fecal metagenomes drawn from simulated microbial communities, we benchmark the performance of thirteen commonly used analytical approaches in terms of diversity estimation, identification of taxon-taxon associations, and assessment of taxon-metadata correlations under the challenge of varying microbial ecosystem loads. We find quantitative approaches including experimental procedures to incorporate microbial load variation in downstream analyses to perform significantly better than computational strategies designed to mitigate data compositionality and sparsity, not only improving the identification of true positive associations, but also reducing false positive detection. When analyzing simulated scenarios of low microbial load dysbiosis as observed in inflammatory pathologies, quantitative methods correcting for sampling depth show higher precision compared to uncorrected scaling.

We identified nine transcription factors (TFs) and their targets, representing 43% of the genome, and 16 regulators that indirectly affect transcription. Only 20% of transcriptional regulation is mediated by canonical TFs when responding to perturbations. Using a Random Forest, we quantified the non-redundant contribution of different mechanisms such as supercoiling, metabolic control, RNA degradation, and chromosome topology to transcriptional changes. Model-predicted gene changes correlate well with experimental data in 95% of the tested perturbations, explaining up to 70% of the total variance when also considering noise.

Systematic mono- and pair-wise fermentation experiments confirmed competition for fructose and cross-feeding of formate. We quantified with a mechanistic model how well tri-culture dynamics was predicted from mono-culture data. With the model as reference, we demonstrated that strains grown in co-culture behaved differently than those in mono-culture and confirmed their altered behavior at the transcriptional level.

Thus, alternative regulators may play a central role in orchestrating RNA levels in these microorganisms. These alternative mechanisms rely on intrinsic features within DNA and RNA molecules, suggesting they are ancestral mechanisms shared among bacteria that could have an increased relevance on transcriptional regulation in minimal cells. In this review, we summarize the alternative elements that can regulate transcript abundance in genome-reduced bacteria and how they contribute to the RNA homeostasis at different levels.","tags":["Gene regulation"],"title":"Alternative transcriptional regulation in genome-reduced bacteria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Junier","E Besray Unal","Eva Yus","Verónica Lloréns-Rico","Luis Serrano"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

Here, we tackle this problem by profiling the transcriptome of the model organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae across 115 growth conditions. We identify three qualitatively different levels of co-expression corresponding to distinct relative orientations and intergenic properties of adjacent genes. We reveal that the degree of co-expression between co-directional adjacent operons, and more generally between genes, is tightly related to their capacity to be transcribed en bloc into the same mRNA. We further show that this genome-wide pervasive transcription of adjacent genes and operons is specifically repressed by DNA regions preferentially bound by RNA polymerases, by intrinsic terminators, and by large intergenic distances. Taken together, our findings suggest that the basal coordination of transcription is mediated by the physical entities and mechanical properties of the transcription process itself, and that operon-like behaviors may strongly vary from condition to condition.","tags":["Gene regulation","Mycoplasma pneumoniae"],"title":"Insights into the mechanisms of basal coordination of transcription using a genome-reduced bacterium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Verónica Lloréns-Rico","Jaime Cano","Tjerko Kamminga","Rosario Gil","Amparo Latorre","Wei-Hua Chen","Peer Bork","John I Glass","Luis Serrano","Maria Lluch-Senar"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

However, the role of most of these RNAs remains unknown, and there is an ongoing discussion as to what extent these transcripts are the result of transcriptional noise. We show, by comparative transcriptomics of 20 bacterial species and one chloroplast, that the number of asRNAs is exponentially dependent on the genomic AT content and that expression of asRNA at low levels exerts little impact in terms of energy consumption. A transcription model simulating mRNA and asRNA production indicates that the asRNA regulatory effect is only observed above certain expression thresholds, substantially higher than physiological transcript levels. These predictions were verified experimentally by overexpressing nine different asRNAs in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Our results suggest that most of the antisense transcripts found in bacteria are the consequence of transcriptional noise, arising at spurious promoters throughout the genome.","tags":["Gene regulation","Mycoplasma pneumoniae"],"title":"Bacterial antisense RNAs are mainly the product of transcriptional noise","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christina Kiel","Hannah Benisty","Verónica Lloréns-Rico","Luis Serrano"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

For example, V600E in the BRAF hydrophobic activation segment (AS) pocket accounts for \u003e95% of all kinase mutations. While many hypotheses tried to explain such significant mutation patterns, conclusive explanations are lacking. Here, we use experimental and in silico structure-energy statistical analyses, to elucidate why the V600E mutation, but no other mutation at this, or any other positions in BRAF’s hydrophobic pocket, is predominant. We find that BRAF mutation frequencies depend on the equilibrium between the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket, the overall folding energy, the activation of the kinase and the number of bases required to change the corresponding amino acid. Using a random forest classifier, we quantitatively dissected the parameters contributing to BRAF AS cancer frequencies. These findings can be applied to genome-wide association studies and prediction models.","tags":null,"title":"The yin–yang of kinase activation and unfolding explains the peculiarity of Val600 in the activation segment of BRAF","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Lluch-Senar","Luca Cozzuto","Jaime Cano","Javier Delgado","Verónica Lloréns-Rico","Sabine Pereyre","Cécile Bebear","Luis Serrano"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

Studying SNPs, non-synonymous mutations, indels and genome rearrangements of these 23 strains and 4 previously sequenced ones, has revealed new subclasses in the two main groups, some of them being associated with the country of isolation. Integrative analysis of in vitro gene essentiality and mutation rates enabled the identification of several putative virulence factors and antigenic proteins; revealing recombination machinery, glycerol metabolism and peroxide production as possible factors in the genetics and physiology of these pathogenic strains. Additionally, the transcriptomes and proteomes of two representative strains, one from each of the two main groups, have been characterized to evaluate the impact of mutations on RNA and proteins levels. This study has revealed that type 2 strains show higher expression levels of CARDS toxin, a protein recently shown to be one of the major factors of inflammation. Thus, we propose that type 2 strains could be more toxigenic than type 1 strains of M. pneumoniae.","tags":["Mycoplasma pneumoniae"],"title":"Comparative “-omics” in Mycoplasma pneumoniae clinical isolates reveals key virulence factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Verónica Lloréns-Rico","Maria Lluch-Senar","Luis Serrano"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

In the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae, we found that small ORFs (smORFs; \u003c 100 residues), accounting for 10% of all ORFs, are the most frequently essential genomic components (53%), followed by conventional ORFs (49%). Essentiality of smORFs may be explained by their function as members of protein and/or DNA/RNA complexes. In larger proteins, essentiality applied to individual domains and not entire proteins, a notion we could confirm by expression of truncated domains. The fraction of essential non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) non-overlapping with essential genes is 5% higher than of non-transcribed regions (0.9%), pointing to the important functions of the former. We found that the minimal essential genome is comprised of 33% (269,410 bp) of the M. pneumoniae genome. Our data highlight an unexpected hidden layer of smORFs with essential functions, as well as non-coding regions, thus changing the focus when aiming to define the minimal essential genome.","tags":["Mycoplasma pneumoniae"],"title":"Defining a minimal cell: essentiality of small ORF s and nc RNA s in a genome‐reduced bacterium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Verónica Lloréns-Rico","Luis Serrano","Maria Lluch-Senar"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

In addition, it is known that methylation plays functionally important roles, including timing of DNA replication, chromosome partitioning, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression. However, full DNA methylome analyses are scarce due to a lack of a simple methodology for rapid and sensitive detection of common epigenetic marks (ie N6-methyladenine (6 mA) and N4-methylcytosine (4 mC)), in these organisms. Here, we use Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing to determine the methylomes of two related human pathogen species, Mycoplasma genitalium G-37 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae M129, with single-base resolution. Our analysis identified two new methylation motifs not previously described in bacteria; a widespread 6 mA methylation motif common to both bacteria (5′-CTAT-3′), as well as a more complex Type I m6A sequence motif in M. pneumoniae (5′-GAN7TAY-3′/3′-CTN7ATR-5′). We identify the methyltransferase responsible for the common motif and suggest the one involved in M. pneumoniae only. Analysis of the distribution of methylation sites across the genome of M. pneumoniae suggests a potential role for methylation in regulating the cell cycle, as well as in regulation of gene expression. To our knowledge, this is one of the first direct methylome profiling studies with single-base resolution from a bacterial organism.","tags":["Mycoplasma pneumoniae"],"title":"Comprehensive Methylome Characterization of Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae at Single-Base Resolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bacteria have a large functional plasticity that allows them to adapt to changing environments and to respond to different stimuli to survive.
